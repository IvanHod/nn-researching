This repo contains some experements with different Neural Networks. Also it contains custom Neural network

## File "custom_conv_model.ipynb"

This file contains custom version of Neural Network developed on numpy.
It contains only 2 layers with bias and works with XOR task for 2 features.

Here the task is to determine the minimal structure of the layers and neurons for simple tasks, 
and to understand "Why it is enough"

## File "line_experiments.ipynb"

Honestly, I do not remember which aim this file contains, but in the future 
I will continue experiments and update readme
